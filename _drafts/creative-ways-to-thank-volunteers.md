title: Creative Ways to Thank Volunteers
---
Volunteers are the lifeblood of workshops. The continuing efforts behind [curriculum](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs), [bridgetroll](https://www.bridgetroll.org/), and [cookbook docs](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/Cookbook) would not move forward without them. If you find it hard to express just how much these volunteers mean try one of these creative ways to say thanks.

1.  **Recognition**  Is this the 2nd, 3rd, or 15th time helping at a workshop?  Recognize the faithfulness of repeat volunteers.  This can be as simple as adding a slide to your slide deck, presenting a certificate at the workshop, verbal recognition, or adding a spotlight note to your chapter website.

2.  **Handwritten thank you note** As simple as it sounds a handwritten note goes a long way.  It's a great way to share the personal impact they've made through their contribution.

3.  **Thank you gathering**  Either post-event or anytime, plan a cook-out, evening out, casual pot-luck dinner, or anything to spend some time after the event reflecting and celebrating with the people who make it possible.

4.  **Volunteer exclusive t-shirt, stickers, or pens**  Consider custom embroidery on a t-shirt, a special run of printed shirts, or stickers (if you have connections with a sponsor or vendor)

5.  **Highlight volunteers in media** Blog about the experience, highlight in local media outlets, or share on social media.

6.  **Volunteer gift bags** Small gift bags with coffee, tea, lifesavers, or other treats.  Vendors or sponsors may provide these at no cost.

7.  **Volunteer outing** Many volunteers take time away from their families to invest in successful workshops.  Make arrangements for the volunteer and family or friends to enjoy a movie, park day, or special outing as a gratitude for the time they spent away.

8.  **Sincere verbal thank you** With social media and messaging taking precedence it's not as common to have a conversation of gratitude.  Take take a few moments to express your thanks in person and share what volunteer efforts mean to you.

Final tips: Thank volunteers often, consider the ways that they like to be appreciated, and be sensitive to those who may not like the limelight when choosing a way to express gratitude.

Thank you chapter organizers, volunteers, teaching assistants, participants spreading the word, and core contributors for all that you do.   You are what makes everything work.
