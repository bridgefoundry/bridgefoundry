**Your donation is fully tax-deductible.** See [About BridgeFoundry](/about) for more non-profit details, including our EIN.

Contributions to Bridge Foundry allow thousands of volunteers across the world
to teach workshops and provide resource to women and others who are underserved
in access to technology and tech skills. Most workshops happen without needing any funds with companies providing space and food for our events. Providing food is an equalizer, making it so people who can't
afford to go out for lunch are not separated from those that can. Meals also
provide a comfortable space for informally networking.

Sometimes the only funds that a volunteer organizer needs is $50
to pay a security guard or $500 for a plane ticket to fly a teacher
to a new community.
