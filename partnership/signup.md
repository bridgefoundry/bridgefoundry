Bridge Foundry partners make a commitment to taking action on improving diversity and inclusion within their company and their community.  As a partner you join a network of other companies that are actively working to make the software industry a better place.

1. Sign up as a Sustaining Sponsor at the level that works for your organization.
2. We will reach out to you for a detailed conversation about any diversity and inclusion programs you have in place already.  We will map a path to leveling up or sharing your success with other partners.
3. Become a partner! We’ll make a public commitment to supporting your efforts & document your commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, including your current programs and plans for future impact.
