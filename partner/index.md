title: Bridge Foundry Industry Partner Program
---

Bridge Foundry and tech companies have a shared goal to create workplaces where everyone can thrive, each person achieving their potential to create software for the business.

Bridge Foundry is seeking companies that are committed to diversity and inclusion.  Working with you, we can define clear steps to create effective, diverse, and inclusive working environments that will scale across the tech industry.

* Are you in a leadership role or have clear support from leadership to make this happen?
* Do you want to increase diversity on your team and arenâ€™t sure how to start?

As an early adopter, you will have the opportunity to help define the program to meet your needs and pay it forward to help other companies in the future.

You will join a network of other companies that are actively working to make the software industry a better place.

## How This Works

We work in the tech industry. We have direct experience of systemic bias
and we see it in practice every day. We're working to transform our knowledge
and practice into clear, replicable techniques that will work for anyone.

We're coders, hackers and makers who have discovered a bug and have been
working together to find a fix.  We experiment, responsibly. We try something,
evaluate what works, and iterate.

We've created this path by walking it. Bridge Foundry has over 9 years of
experience creating diverse, collaborative teams who work together toward a
common goal. We have developed some key research questions in collaboration
with experienced research professionals.

We believe our techniques will work at scale and the research will validate
that others can replicate this approach and achieve the intended effects.
