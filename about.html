        <h2>About Bridge Foundry</h2>
        <p>
          Bridge Foundry was formed in late 2012 by the people who make <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> workshops happen.  RailsBridge was originally envisioned as an umbrella organization for many projects focused on making technology more accessible to people who are underrepresented in tech. The workshops were a breakout success, including the creation of new organizations focused on other technologies.  We felt that a new name for the umbrella organization would help convey its purpose and allow the workshops to thrive under the name for which they are known.  We welcome organization which were inspired by RailsBridge and others to collaborate, sharing resources and solutions.</p>
        <p>In the US, Bridge Foundry has 501c3 non-profit status, with <a href="http://schoolfactory.org/">School Factory</a> as its fiscal sponsorship.  We look forward to future collaboration with the School Factory network of maker spaces and share our curricula and community building experience.</p>
