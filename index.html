          <h2>Pioneers of the Learn to Code Movement</h2>
          <!-- <p>Since 2009, Bridge Foundry has empowered people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others. Bridge Foundry was instrumental in the creation of the learn to code movement. Using our open-source curricula and teaching techniques, hundreds of workshops in dozens of cities around the world have been organized and taught by volunteers.</p> -->
          <p>62 women attended the first RailsBridge workshop in June 2009. In the less than six months, the workshops transformed the San Francisco Ruby meetup from 2% to 18% women. Bridge Foundry has expanded outreach to communities with even greater underrepresentation in tech, as well as expanding to more technologies.</p>
          <p>Bridge Foundry was instrumental in the creation of the learn to code movement. In over 80 cities around the world, volunteers have organized and taught workshops based on our open source curricula and teaching techniques.

          <!-- There are now eight Bridges which now host online communities and other activities, as well as teaching free in-person workshops with outreach to people who are underrepresented in tech. -->

        <h2>Students becomes teachers and teachers become mentors.</h2>
        <p>Bridge Foundry’s key differentiator from other tech training initiatives is its focus on training repeat participants as teachers. As teachers/leaders, Bridge Foundry volunteers learn to catch and correct disrespectful behavior in human interaction, along with gaps in technical understanding. While the focus is on technical skill development, we also see that these leadership skills also contribute to workplace transformation by creating change agents within the tech industry.</p>

      <h2>A community of practice and an ecosystem for technologists, volunteers, industry leaders, students, and companies.</h2>
      <p>Bridge Foundry partners with tech companies that host workshops, where they offer space and staff who get involved as volunteers.
      Expert programmers volunteer and find that they improve their technical skills as well as their communication skills. Volunteers
      learn from each other and from students who have work experience in different domains or different technologies.</p>
      <p>This collaboration create a strong professional network, helping companies recruit the best talent, while new and experienced
      software developers get to know the companies that foster a postivie, collaborative working environment.</p>

We are dedicated to doing whatever it takes so that the makers of technology are reflective of our society, because diversity fosters innovation.</p><p>  We offer free, open source materials and online resources. Even expert volunteers learn by teaching.

          <h2>How to get involved</h2>
          <p>Everything we do is open source and replicable by volunteers who
            can act independently to create positive change in their communities.
            Our free workshops typically have waitlists, so we encourage anyone
            to replicate the events.</p>

            <p>There's no need to ask permission if someone wants to create an
              event to teach other people technical skills. We ask only that
              you offer the event at no cost to students, follow our <a href="https://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>, and do outreach to underserved individuals.  Please
              use our <a href="http://bridgetroll.org">online registration website</a> which will ensure that all
              participants review the code of conduct before signing up.
             </p>

            <p>Volunteers have the freedom to act independently, and we are
              stronger together and we want to help. We encourage people to volunteer first at one of our events to learn
              from more experienced organizers and teachers. We have curricula for many
              different technologies and a network of volunteers who will mentor
              new organizers and often will be able to connect you to other Volunteers
              in your area.</p>

          <p>We think of new initiatives and events like the old folktale about <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/2009/10/stone-soup-workshop/">stone soup</a>.
            A brave and passionate volunteer wants to make their community more
            inclusive and welcoming or build a new community that will help them
            learn a new skill and we help find others who will make that happen
            or simply provide information about what has worked before and cheer
            them on!</p>

        <!-- <h2>Get Involved</h2> -->
        <p>Most volunteer activities are focused on coding and leveling up in tech, and there is plenty of high impact work for people with a wide range
          of skills and interests. We need more folks willing to write words,
          create images, conduct research, and develop materials about effective
          teaching and positive conflict resolution. Of course, there are opportunities to write code too.</p>
