On May 28th, 2019, the London Bridges gathered for the first time across
four different technical communities (Ruby, Clojure, Go and Scala), bringing
together students, volunteers, teachers and organizers to celebrate how we
have increased diversity and inclusion in our communities, and to share stories
of our successes and challenges.

Local leaders of Bridge Foundry chapters exchanged ideas with supporters and
leaders of other mission-aligned groups over lively dinner conversation followed
by a short presentation and discussion.

Sarah Allen shared the history of the grassroots organization, how Bridge
Foundry started as RailsBridge and grew to include volunteer-led communities all
over the world across 8 programming languages. The London leaders shared
more detail about UK events across several years. The first two events were
organized in Edinburgh, Scotland, first RailsBridge in conjunction with
Scottish Ruby Conference, which inspired Ali King to organize a ClojureBridge
workshop in the same city. Sarah talked about how each workshop is an epic
event, organized by regular folks who work in the tech industry, often with
no teaching or event organizing experience, led to participate through a desire
to create change or learn more themselves.
