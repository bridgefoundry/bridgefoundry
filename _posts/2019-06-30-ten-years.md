title: Happy 10th Birthday to our open source workshop model!

Approximately 200 software developers attended Golden Gate Ruby Con 2009. Six of
them were women. Two of them were named Sarah.

In 2009, almost 30% of software developers in general were women, versus about
3% in open source, which is exactly what Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen experienced
in the San Francisco Ruby community. They decided to change that by offering a
free workshop to teach Ruby on Rails to other women. They estimated that if they
could teach 10-20 women per month and 10% stayed in the community, it would
triple the number of women in the community to 20% women in a year.

The first workshop was intended to have a maximum of 40 students, but after two
tweets and one mailing list post, there was a waiting list. Orange Labs offered
their large office space with 8 conference rooms. By enlisting men as well as
women to teach and TA, we were able to expand the capacity -- 62 students
participated in an overwhelmingly successful
[first event](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2009/06/14/the-first-rails-workshop/)
along with 10 teachers and a dad who volunteered to supervise the kids play area
… and the pattern for open source workshops was established.

With enthusiastic support of more teachers and students who returned to help
volunteer, we hosted workshops for about 50 students every other month -- in
between were regularly scheduled meetups with tech talks and hack nights.  In
less than 6 months, we were on track to meeting our goal with 18% women at the
regular SF Ruby Meetup events. Additionally, we noticed other significant impact
on our local community: more meetup events, more events targeted at less
experienced engineers and more experienced women Ruby developers coming to
events. By the end of 2009, via travelling Sarahs, we had held workshops in
Hawaii and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

We met in January to figure out how to effectively pass on the knowledge of how
to make workshops happen. We wrote a
[cookbook](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/WorkshopCookbook/wiki/Minimum-Viable-Workshop)
for new organizers

In the subsequent years, the number of workshops doubled each year, and also
inspired other communities and organizations.  In 2013, RailsBridge renamed
itself Bridge Foundry, reflecting that the open source workshop approach was
being used by groups for many different technologies. In 2014,
[ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/) and
[MobileBridge](https://github.com/mobilebridge) were formed, each focused on
separate technologies, in Summer 2015,
[GoBridge](http://golangbridge.org/) started with several workshops, an
[online forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/), and an innovative partner
program and in 2016 [ScalaBridge](https://bridgefoundry.org/2018/02/15/scalabridge),
[RustBridge](https://rustbridge.com/), [ElixirBridge](http://elixirbridge.org/)
and [ElmBridge](https://twitter.com/elmlangbridge)
gathered volunteers to create open source curricula and teach free outreach
workshops.

Today, Bridges teach workshops, introduce participants to open source, teach
ongoing courses and constantly invent new ways to support and encourage
diversity in the technology industry. Volunteers in 88 cities across 16
countries have been inspired to create diverse and inclusive communities and
contribute to building a future where we all can …. Love technology? Want to
