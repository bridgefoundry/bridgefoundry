We’re kicking off a project to figure out what it will take to create a
non-profit organization in the UK to support the work of the volunteers who have
been organizing events and teaching Ruby, Clojure, Go, Scala and Haskell! Even
though a San Francisco RailsBridge workshop is more like a Brighton RailsBridge
than a San Francisco Women Who Go meetup, from a legal perspective Brighton and
San Francisco are completely different.

## High impact events, viral growth
Bridge Foundry started in 2009 with a simple hypothesis that a local in-person
workshop to teach other women Ruby would cause more women to want to code in
Ruby. In less than 6 months, the San Francisco Ruby meetup went from 2% to 18%
women. The agile, open source approach spread across the US… across languages,
hosted by many different companies and organizations. Now nearly a decade later
there have been more than 500 events in 19 countries. Across the UK, volunteers
have hosted workshops and meetup events using our open source materials and have
contributed new curriculum, along with building diverse communities.

## Why legal support is needed
Even though the movement is bigger globally than in the United States, it was in
the US that we were threatened multiple times with legal action, and US-based
philanthropists who first asked for a tax deductible donation. In 2017, we
created a new US corp and the IRS approved 501c3 designation as a charitable
organization. We found an [excellent law firm](https://www.nixonpeabody.com)
with international offices and created a corporate structure to support the
grassroots communities – we can still offer open source materials and online
resources to anyone, but there are limitations about the support we can give to
volunteers outside the US. Since London is an active hub with multiple different
bridge communities, and there are local volunteers willing to take point with
the legal team, we are now investing in figuring out how to make a UK-based
non-profit -- and from there, a generalized country kit to help volunteers
across the world.

## A step towards a bigger goal
Building resilient organizations is no small challenge, but we have a good track
record on starting small and iterating to reach a big goal. In addition to being
able to raise tax deductible funds, process expense reports and award grants,
there are more complex questions around the legal support for our [code of
conduct](http://bridgefoundry.org/code-of-conduct) – the UK is likely to have
protections for our work. In the longer term, we need to consider how we will
support volunteers where there aren’t legal protections and support for the idea
that everyone should have equal access to technology, be treated with respect,
and the opportunity to learn to code.
