We're kicking off a project to figure out what it will take to create a
non-profit organization in the UK to support the work of the volunteers who
have been organizing events and teaching Ruby, Clojure, Go, Scala and Haskell!
Across the UK, volunteers  have hosted workshops and meetup events using our
open source materials and have contributed new curriculum, along with building
diverse communities.

We're an agile, grassroots movement, which doesn't strictly require corporate
structure, yet an organization creates resiliency
and accelerates the work. We stepped up to the challenge of creating a structure
that supports innovation at all levels of our volunteer-led organzation.
A key part of this challenge is that most of the volunteers have greater
affinity to a specific programming language or framework than to a particular
country. Of course, laws are different in different regions. It's not just about
finances which most people think of first, the changes that we seek to
enable access to technology for all people can have unexpected legal implications.

Bridge Foundry started with a simple hypothesis that a local in-person workshop to teach other women Ruby would cause more women to want to code in Ruby.  In less than 6 months, the San Francisco Ruby meetup went from 2% to 18% women, and even before that, the agile, open source approach spread across the US… across languages, hosted by many different companies and organizations.

Now nearly a decade later there have been more than 500 events in 16 countries. Quite some growth!  Our mantra in the early days was “let nothing stand in the way of a workshop” -- despite exponential growth there was always more demand, and we realized that the scarce resource was people willing to organize workshops.  Companies were eager to host and pay for food and childcare; expert software engineers and past students enjoyed teaching; but all the logistical details were a burden on people with day jobs.  We wanted to build a [starfish organization](http://rachelmyers.github.io/starfish.html) that would be resilient and grow, so we focused our efforts on providing open source materials and connecting volunteer leaders with companies and with each other, raising a small amount of money for seed grants, augmenting the local fundraising model to help new volunteer organizers.

Along the way, we ran into legal questions and pro-bono lawyers helped us explain how outreach to people who are underserved is not discrimination against white men.  Even though the movement is bigger globally than in the United States, it was in the US that we were threatened multiple times with legal action, and US-based philanthropists who first asked for a tax deductible donation.  In 2017, we created a new US corp and the IRS approved 501c3 designation as a charitable organization.  We found an [excellent law firm](https://www.nixonpeabody.com) with international offices and created a corporate structure to support the grassroots communities -- we could still offer open source materials and online resources to anyone, but there were limitations about the support we could give to volunteers outside the US.

Even though a San Francisco RailsBridge workshop is more like a Brighton RailsBridge than a San Francisco Women Who Go meetup, from a legal perspective Brighton and San Francisco are completely different.  Each country (and even US states) have quite different legal frameworks.  Since London was an active hub with multiple different bridge communities, and there were local volunteers willing to take point with the legal team, we decided that we would invest in figuring out how to make a UK-based non-profit (and from that, perhaps a generalized country kit to help volunteers across the world).

This is no small challenge, yet we have a good track record on starting small and iterating to reach a big goal.  In addition to being able to raise funds that are tax deductible, process expense reports and all the money things, there are more complex questions are around the legal support for our code of conduct -- the UK is likely to have similar, yet different protections for our work. In the longer term, we need to consider how we would support volunteers where there aren’t legal protections for the basic human right than anyone should have equal access to technology, be treated with respect, and the opportunity to  learn to code.
