*Post by Sarah Allen* <br>
Bridge Foundry volunteers share skills by creating open source curriculum,
at free teaching events and in online mcommunities. Through teaching and
organizing, we learn to be leaders, as well as levelling up our own tech skills.
Most workshops are organized by independent communities, sometimes by one
individual who has been to a workshop at a conference and then decided to
create a community where they live.

From its beginnings as RailsBridge, we have grown to include 8 Bridges, which
now include ClojureBridge, MobileBridge, GoBridge, ElmBridge, ElixirBridge,
ScalaBridge, and RustBridge.

Each bridge focuses on different technologies. Every event connects working
software developers and community or industry leaders to people
in our communities who are underserved intech, which is actually a majority of
the people in our society.

Every event is organized by volunteers with teachers and TAs who range
from industry experts to people who know just a little bit more than the
students.  With technology always changing both teachers and students learn
together.
