Bridge Foundry's CEO, Sarah Allen, shared the organization's 2017 diversity
impact results and successes teaching code skills to people underserved in the
tech industry. Starting with the organization's history and growth, she was
joined by sponsor representatives who shared their insights on this work and
then moving on to describe the next steps in making diversity the norm in the
tech industry.

## History of Rapid Growth

In 2009-2013, the RailsBridge workshops went viral, with the
number of workshops doubling year-over-year and sparked the creation of many
other initiatives.

Sarah highlighted how the grassroots organization grew organically and with
intention, across many programming languages and frameworks. Each technology and
each community is led by volunteers who believe this work is important enough
to take time away from their busy lives to do the work.

## Vision: a future where diversity is normal

We have learned that a good first step to creating diverse teams is to change
expectations. At first, the workshops were an "existence proof" -- most male
volunteers met more technical women at a single workshops than they had in their
whole lifetime.  We believe this problem won't be solved with skill development
for people underrepresented in tech. We need to eliminate disrespectful work
environments.

volunteers how to handle difficult conversations when needed.
