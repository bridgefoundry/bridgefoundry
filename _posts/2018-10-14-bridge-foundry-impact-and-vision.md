On October 11, 2018, community and tech leaders gathered at the Kapor Center
in Oakland, CA to hear about Bridge Foundry's impact and vision for the future,
including the announcement of the new [industry outreach program](https://bridgefoundry.org/news/2018-10-11-industry-partner-program).

Bridge Foundry's CEO, Sarah Allen, shared the organization's 2017 diversity
impact results and successes teaching code skills to people underserved in the
tech industry. Starting with the organization's history and growth, she was
joined by sponsor representatives who shared their insights on this work and
then moving on to describe the next steps in making diversity the norm in the
tech industry.

## History of Rapid Growth

In 2009-2013, the RailsBridge workshops went viral, with the
number of workshops doubling year-over-year and sparked the creation of many
other initiatives.

Sarah highlighted how the grassroots organization grew organically and with
intention, across many programming languages and frameworks. Each technology and
each community is led by volunteers who believe this work is important enough
to take time away from their busy lives to do the work.

## Stories of impact

Bridge Foundry sponsors do more than financial support -- each company
participates the work of creating culture change in the tech industry. A panel
from 2018 sustaining sponsors and long-time supporters shared stories of how
their work and company culture reflects our shared values and how working with
Bridge Foundry programs and volunteers has created impact.

Valerie Liberty from  [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) cited the company’s 10+
year friendship with Bridge Foundry, recalling
[early support](https://blog.balsamiq.com/bridge-foundry/). Enlightened
communication and respectful work practices foster accessibility and diversity,
not just in hiring practices but also in customer success.

Anna Neyzberg from [Carbon Five](https://www.carbonfive.com/), who has also
served on the [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org) board
and founded [ElixirBridge](http://elixirbridge.org/), shared how hosting
workshops and events has helped Carbon Five stay connected to the larger tech
community. Helping underrepresented folks level up so that they can find work in
tech aligns strongly with Carbon Five's belief that diverse teams work more
effectively and can more effectively collaborate with a wide range of clients.

Kelley Robinson from [Twillio](https://www.twilio.com) talked about their
support of [ScalaBridge](http://www.scalabridge.org/), which
grew out of a need to connect with the growing community of Scala developers.
As a Developer Advocate, Kelley hosts workshops at the company, continuing
a long tradition of Twillio employees who have volunteered to teach new
languages to old and new coders.

## Vision: a future where diversity is normal

We have learned that a good first step to creating diverse teams is to change
expectations. At first, the workshops were an "existence proof" -- most male
volunteers met more technical women at a single workshops than they had in their
whole lifetime.  We believe this problem won't be solved with skill development
for people underrepresented in tech. We need to eliminate disrespectful work
environments.

An interactive session modeled on Bridge Foundry’s new curriculum, which trains
volunteers how to speak up and have "difficult conversations" as needed.  It is
risky to speak up when you don't know what today, yet silence conveys approval
and saying something is usually better than saying nothing. Practicing how to
respond to racist, sexist or plain old disrespectful comments makes it easier
to respond appropriately when we hear something innappropriate in real life.

Audience members participated in small group discussions grappling with a less
challenging version of the curriculum on how to respond to "awkward
situtations," which in retrospect is perhaps even more important. If we can
learn to speak up when witnessing disrespectful behavior that is in that space
of plausible deniability or where someone honestly had no idea of how
innapropriate their statement was, then we can create spaces where really bad
behavior is inconceivable.
